### UnixAPI
A Custom wine module that expose the host system to the programs

### How to build...?
Well, not sure too, but this is what I did:
- Move this repo to the wine repo at: `dlls/nvencodeapi`
- Run in the wine repo root: `./configure`
- Go to the `dlls/nvencodeapi`
- Run `make`

### Why? ...Why not?

## Any issue?
Sorry this shit is entire done by someone that don't know how to create a wine module, as you can see this shit is just a rewrited code of the nvencodeapi.dll, why I don't rename? because with that the wine ./configure generate the makefile to me, I don't know do that too.
Also, I'm not a C++ dev too, don't care for the quality of this shit.


### x64 version?
Sorry I don't know how to build in the x64 as well, if you send me the binary or give step-by-step instructions will be cool :)
