### UnixAPI
A Custom wine module that expose the host system to the programs

### How to build...?
Well, not sure too, but this is what I did:
- Move this repo to the wine repo at: `dlls/nvencodeapi`
- Run in the wine repo root: `./configure`
- Go to the `dlls/nvencodeapi`
- Run `make`

### Why? ...Why not?
